   - Enable sound if desired
   - Choose display mode: Custom App (persistent), Notification (temporary), or Both
5. Save the automation and trigger it manually to test

### 🗑️ Clearing the Display

If you need to remove the DPC Alert app from your AWTRIX devices:

1. Create an automation using the "AWTRIX DPC Alert - Clear App 🗑️" blueprint
2. Select your AWTRIX device(s)
3. Save and trigger it manually whenever needed

## 🎯 Features

  - Green: Ordinary
  - Yellow: Moderate
  - Dark Orange: High
  - Red: Extreme

- **Customizable icons**: Use different icons for each risk type (GIF format recommended)
- **Sound notifications**: Optional sound alerts for critical warnings with configurable threshold
- **Display modes**: Choose between Custom App (persistent), Notification (temporary), or Both
- **Flexible duration**: Separate durations for custom apps and notifications
- **Hold mode**: Notifications with duration 0 stay on screen until manually dismissed
- **Multi-device**: Supports multiple AWTRIX devices simultaneously
- **Auto-clear**: Automatically removes alerts when they are no longer active
- **Test mode**: Send test notifications to verify configuration with all display options
- **Manual clear**: Remove apps from display when needed

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Customizing Message Duration

The blueprint provides two duration settings:

- **Message Duration**: Controls display time for custom apps (persistent mode)
  - `0` = use the device's global time setting
  - `1-300` = specific seconds (maximum 5 minutes)

- **Notification Duration**: Controls display time for notifications
  - `0` = hold mode (notification stays until manually dismissed via middle button)
  - `1-300` = auto-dismiss after specified seconds

### Display Modes

The blueprint supports three display modes:

- **Custom App (Persistent)**: Alert stays on AWTRIX as a persistent app until cleared
  - Published to MQTT topic `{prefix}/custom/dpc_alert`
  - Uses message_duration setting
  - Ideal for ongoing alerts you want to monitor continuously

- **Notification (Temporary)**: Pop-up notification that appears immediately
  - Published to MQTT topic `{prefix}/notify`
  - Uses notification_duration setting
  - When duration is 0, includes `hold: true` (dismiss with middle button)
  - Ideal for immediate attention alerts

- **Both**: Sends both custom app and notification simultaneously
  - Maximum visibility for critical alerts
  - Custom app persists while notification provides immediate pop-up

### Visual Effects

The blueprint provides configurable visual effects based on alert severity:

- **Rainbow Text Effect** (rainbow_level setting):
  - Applies colorful rainbow animation to alert text
  - Default: 0 (disabled)
  - When enabled, overrides the solid color setting
  - Set to desired minimum alert level (1-4) to enable for that level and above
  - Note: Rainbow and color are mutually exclusive (AWTRIX API limitation)

- **Ripple Effect** (ripple_level setting):
  - Creates an animated background ripple effect
  - Default: 3 (Orange/High criticality and above)
  - Uses AWTRIX defaults: speed=3, Rainbow palette, blend=true
  - Set to 0 to disable completely, or adjust threshold (1-4) as needed
  - Applied when alert level >= configured threshold

**Customization Examples:**
- Disable all effects: Set both rainbow_level and ripple_level to 0
- Maximum effects: Set rainbow_level to 1 (enables for all alerts)
- Conservative: Keep defaults (rainbow disabled, ripple at level 3+)
- Extreme only: Set both to 4 (Red alerts only)

### Using Custom Icons

You can use any icon from LaMetric or upload custom ones to your AWTRIX `/ICONS/` folder. Enter the icon filename (without extension) in the corresponding fields. The blueprint references icons by name, not by LaMetric ID.

**Icon format:** GIF format is recommended for best compatibility with AWTRIX.

For detailed instructions on uploading icons, see the [Icons Upload Guide](ICONS_UPLOAD.md).

### AWTRIX Notifications vs Custom Apps

Understanding the difference between display modes:

- **Custom App**: Persistent alert that stays visible until cleared
  - Topic: `{prefix}/custom/dpc_alert`
  - Duration controlled by `message_duration`
  - Best for: Ongoing weather alerts you want to monitor
  
- **Notification**: Temporary pop-up that overlays current display
  - Topic: `{prefix}/notify`
  - Duration controlled by `notification_duration`
  - When duration = 0: Includes `hold: true` (manual dismiss required)
  - Best for: Immediate attention alerts

- **Both**: Combines persistence and immediacy
  - Custom app provides continuous visibility
  - Notification ensures immediate attention

### Payload Structure

The blueprint generates AWTRIX-compatible payloads with these properties:

```json
{
  "icon": "dpc-warning",
  "text": "Alert message",
  "duration": 20,
  "color": "#FF6000",     // Only when rainbow is disabled
  "rainbow": true,        // Only when level >= rainbow_level setting
  "stack": false,
  "overlay": "clear",
  "effect": "Ripple",     // Only when level >= ripple_level setting
  "sound": "alarm",       // Optional, based on enable_sound and sound_level
  "hold": true            // Only for notifications with duration=0
}
```

## 📝 Notes

- The blueprint uses "restart" mode to avoid duplicates when multiple alerts arrive
- Custom apps are published to MQTT topic `{prefix}/custom/dpc_alert`
- Notifications are published to MQTT topic `{prefix}/notify`
- If there are multiple active alerts, they will be displayed in sequence
- Rainbow text and ripple effects are configurable with level thresholds (default: rainbow disabled, ripple at level 3+)
- Rainbow and color are mutually exclusive per AWTRIX API (rainbow takes precedence when enabled)
- Icon files should be in GIF format and uploaded to AWTRIX `/ICONS/` folder
- Notifications with duration=0 automatically use hold mode (manual dismiss required)
- Home Assistant's Jinja2 sandbox restrictions: Uses `dict()` constructor instead of `.update()` method
